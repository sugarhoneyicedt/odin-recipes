    <h2>These homemade cinnamon rolls can be whipped up in only 90 minutes.</h2>
    <p> Cinnamon rolls are the epitome of cozy indulgence, featuring soft, fluffy dough spiraled with a generous filling of cinnamon, sugar, and butter.
        These delightful pastries are often started with a simple yeast dough, rolled out into a rectangle, then smothered in a mixture thatâ€™s sweet, spicy, and irresistibly buttery.
        Once rolled, sliced, and baked, they puff up into golden swirls with invitingly warm centers.
        The finishing touch is a smooth, rich glaze or creamy frosting, drizzled or spread over the warm rolls, seeping into every spiral.</p>
